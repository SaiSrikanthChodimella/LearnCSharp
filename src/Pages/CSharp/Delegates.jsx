        <p>
          A delegate is a type-safe pointer to a method that allows you to call
          a method indirectly at runtime. You can think of it as a container for
          functions.
        </p>

        <Section title="Key Points"></Section>
        <List
          items={[
            "Used for callbacks (communication between two components).",
            "A reference type that holds the address of a method.",
            "Helps decouple code (avoids hardcoded logic).",
            "Lambda expressions are built on delegates.",
            "Signature of the delegate must match the method it points to.",
            "Acts like a classâ€”you create an instance of a delegate and pass it around.",
            "Has similar Syntax as method but has as delegate keyword as modifier",
          ]}
        />
      </Section>

      <Section title="Delegates and Event Handling">
        <p>
          Delegates are heavily used in event handling to create loosely coupled
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>Event handling works like this:</p>
        <List
          items={[
            "A publisher (event sender) raises an event.",
            "A subscriber (event receiver) listens to the event and reacts.",
            "The publisher does not need to know about subscribers, making the system flexible.",
          ]}
        />
        <p>
          Idea is to hook receivers to respective publisher, and publishers have
          no information on subscribers
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Anonymous Methods">
        <p>
          Anonymous methods allow you to create inline methods without
          explicitly defining a new function.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Multicast Delegate">
        <p>
          A multicast delegate can hold multiple methods and execute them in
          order.
        </p>
        <p>Key Points:</p>
        <List
          items={[
            "Use += to add methods.",
            "Use -= to remove methods.",
            "If the delegate has a return type, it returns the result of the last method in the list.",
          ]}
        />
        <p>
          The functions are invoked as per invocation List Order (that order is
          defined by in which order you register them)
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Func, Action, Predicate">
        <p>
          Predefined delegates to avoid creating custom delegate types and can
          have 0 to 16 parameters.
        </p>
        <List
          items={[
            "Action<T> (No Return Type) - Always returns void.",
            "Func<T, TResult> (Returns a Value) - The last type is the return type.",
            "Predicate<T> (Returns bool) - Used when you need to check a condition and return true or false",
          ]}
        />
        <p>LINQ is entirely based on Actions, Func and Predicates</p>
      </Section>
