            Here the thread is locked for quite some duration (based on task)
          </li>
          <li>
            So, if new requests are added on top, new threads would be created
            as CPU is still busy with the current thread, new threads consume
            loads of memory

          <li>
            Threads are not locked as in Sync Programming (so after execution
            the threads are moved back to the thread pool) and new threads are
            not created, saves a lot of memory and CPU load.

          <li>Using Async Keyword turns a method into Asynchronous method</li>
          <li>
            Await keyword can be used only inside method with Async modifier
          </li>
          <li>
            Await suspends the calling method until the task is completed then,
            returns the control to caller
          </li>
          <li>
            Async wraps the return into a task implicitly and await unwraps the
            task implicitly
          </li>
          <li>Return Type of Async Method is either void or Task</li>
          <li>
            Use Async keyword on methods to mark the method as asynchronous
            method
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Await key word on the operation which is a task (when code
            reached the point, we wait for the task to be finished, once
            finished then we move ahead) â€“ an async method cannot move past
            await until task is done
          </li>
          <li>Also, when calling this method use await Keyword</li>
          <li>Benefit of this is that, this way we do not block the thread.</li>
          <li>
            Also, while using Async the return is wrapped automatically around
            task, to unwarp it use await
          </li>

        <p>Works like magic with Entity Framework</p>
